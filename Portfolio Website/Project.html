        #Full Stack Developer<br>

          As a Full Stack Developer I bring a robust skill set and years of
          hands-on experience in various essential programming languages and
          technologies. I have a solid foundation in front-end development with
          HTML, boasting a commendable two years of experience in crafting
          user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. Additionally, I
          possess extensive proficiency in JavaScript, with a substantial
          three-year track record of implementing dynamic and interactive
          elements to enhance user experiences.<br />
          CSS is another cornerstone of my skill set, with three years of
          experience in styling and layout design, ensuring seamless and
          aesthetically pleasing web applications. I excel in leveraging Data
          Structures, which forms the backbone of efficient algorithms and
          optimized code, honed through one year of practical application.
